# Bannerlord Orphans Adoption

This is a mod for Mount and Blade Bannerlord.

[Nexus link](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/2769/)

As of version 1.5.8, children from destroyed clan are considered "lost".
With this mod, these children will be taken in by a friendly clan, if any.

This mod uses Harmony to patch the Apply method of DestroyClanAction, so it may conflict with other mods that patch the same method.
